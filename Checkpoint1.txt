Exercises
Create a new repository on GitHub to hold your assignments for the Databases module. Create a new branch for Checkpoint 1. Submit your answers.

1. What data types do each of these values represent?

"A Clockwork Orange" - string
42 - integer
09/02/1945 - date
98.7 - float
$15.99 - string

1.  Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database is used when information needs to be searchable/updatable by multiple applications simultaneously.  This information will persist beyond the termination of the application process.  

Text files can be useful, but they cannot be updated simultaneously and they are not optimized for searching/storing data.


3.  Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is a declarative language - you are just running commands you are not writing the algorithms to execute them (although you can program in additional functions/rules).  

4.  In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

At a high level, the database is a separate application that you build separately from the API.  The database is stored separately and sends information to/from the API as requested.

5.  Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

SQL databases are set up like an excel spreadsheet - the tables contain the information in rows (horizontal) and columns (verticals).  Values are the data found in the intersection row/column.  

A database holds multiple tables, and these can be related to one another via primary and secondary keys.  

Tables are column/row pairs that hold data.  Columns define the table and when you build the table you indicate in the columns the name of the data and the type of data you will store there.  Rows are added/removed/updated from the table later and are filled with data corresponding to the columns.


6.  List three data types that can be used in a table.

Integer, Float, Date

7.  Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

That will return all the date and amount pairs from the table

date: 		amount:
'2016-05-01'	1500.00
'2016-05-10'	37.00
'2016-05-15'	124.93
'2016-05-23'	54.72


     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

This will return only payments over 500

amount:
1500.00

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

This will return all rows which match the payee value of 'Mega Foods':

date:		payee:		amount:		memo:
'2016-05-15'	'Mega Foods'	124.93		'Groceries'


8.  Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

SELECT email, signup
FROM users
WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

Should return

email			signup
'datad@comcast.net'	'2008-01-20'

The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

SELECT userid
FROM users
WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

Should return:

userid
1

All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

SELECT * FROM users
WHERE userid = 4;

Should return:

userid	name			email			signup
4	'Brandy Boolean'	'bboolean@nasa.gov'	'1999-10-15'
